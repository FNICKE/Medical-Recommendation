        Building a Symptom-Based Disease Diagnosis Web App with Flask & Machine Learning
      </h2>

      <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed text-gray-200">
        In the age of technology and information, access to accurate and timely healthcare is more critical than ever.
        With the increasing importance of remote healthcare solutions, we embarked on a journey to develop a symptom-based
        disease diagnosis web application. Leveraging Flask for the backend and a Decision Tree Classifier model, we created
        a user-friendly platform that can help users identify potential illnesses based on their reported symptoms.

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-300 mb-2">The Problem</h3>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-200">
          The project began with recognizing a common issue: people often experience symptoms and want quick answers about
          their health concerns. It can be challenging to differentiate between various diseases, especially when symptoms
          overlap. Our goal was to provide a convenient solution for users to input their symptoms and receive potential diagnoses.

      <div class="mb-8">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-300 mb-2">The Solution</h3>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 text-gray-200">
          We developed a web app that allows users to enter a list of symptoms they are experiencing. The app then uses a
          pre-trained Decision Tree Classifier model to predict the most likely disease based on the provided symptoms. Here's how it works:
        </p>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-100">
          <li><strong>Symptom Input:</strong> Users enter their symptoms through a user-friendly interface.</li>
          <li><strong>Machine Learning Model:</strong> Trained on a symptom-disease dataset for accurate predictions.</li>
          <li><strong>Prediction:</strong> Instant output based on the model's results.</li>
          <li><strong>Additional Information:</strong> Provides disease details, precautions, medications, diet, and workout tips.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

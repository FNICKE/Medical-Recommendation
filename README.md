## 🖼 **Project Output**  

Here’s how the **Medical Recommendation System** works in action! 📊  

### **1️⃣ User Inputs Symptoms**  
🔹 The user provides symptoms like **fever, cough, headache, etc.**  

### **2️⃣ AI Processes Input & Analyzes Severity**  
🧠 The AI **matches symptoms with medical data** and assigns a **severity level**.  

### **3️⃣ Personalized Recommendations Generated**  
💊 Based on the severity level, the system suggests:  
✅ **Medications** (e.g., Paracetamol for mild fever)  
✅ **Diet Plan** (e.g., More vitamin C-rich foods)  
✅ **Workout Plan** (e.g., Light walking if mild symptoms)  

### **4️⃣ User Receives Interactive Output**  
📢 The results are displayed in an **interactive dashboard**, showing:  
📌 **Health Status** – Normal, Moderate, or Severe  
📌 **Treatment Advice** – Medications & lifestyle changes  
📌 **Progress Tracking** – AI learns from user feedback

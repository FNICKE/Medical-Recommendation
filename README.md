# Medical Recommendation System for Personalized Healthcare
## Project Description:
This project aims to develop a comprehensive Medical Recommendation System that leverages various data sources to provide personalized healthcare recommendations. The system focuses on improving patient care by suggesting customized diet plans, workout routines, and medications based on individual symptoms and severity. Using a combination of databases, machine learning models, and expert insights, the system is designed to assist both healthcare providers and patients in making informed decisions.

### Installation :
- npm install pip
- pip install pandas
- pip install numpy

## Key Features
- Symptom Severity Analysis :
        - Users can input their symptoms, and the system uses a severity scale to determine the urgency and possible conditions associated with the symptoms.

-  Personalized Medical Recommendations :
          - Based on symptom severity and user data, the system suggests possible treatments, medications, and lifestyle adjustments.

- Dietary Recommendations :
           -The system offers diet plans tailored to usersâ€™ health conditions. The recommendations aim to improve overall health and complement medical treatments.

- Customized Workout Plans :
            -Workout routines are designed to cater to users' specific health conditions, ensuring that physical activity is safe and beneficial.

- Continuous Learning :
            - The system uses machine learning techniques to refine recommendations based on user feedback, medical advancements, and ongoing data input.

## Technologies Used
 - Python: Backend development and machine learning (ML) model integration.
 - Jupyter Notebooks: For developing and testing machine learning models, exploring data, and running experiments.
 - Pandas & NumPy: Data handling and manipulation.
